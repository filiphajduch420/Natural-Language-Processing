Series 1 - 80%, Series 2 - 90%, Series 3 - 100%, Series 4 - 100% - Perfectly written and acted character transformation. One of the best season finales of all time. --- Season 5 has been an incredible ride so far, and I can't wait for the summer to finish. --- That's it. The end of one of the best shows ever, and it's got a great ending that poor Dexter can only quietly envy. And the comparison is simply unavoidable, if only because of the certain "similarity" of the final scene, which highlights the gulf between the quality of the ending of Breaking Bad and Dexter. Walter White definitely deserved such a great ending. Season 5 - 100 %
All hail Heisenberg. I was originally at 5*, but the 4th series just doesn't pull anymore. Tedious, drawn out dialogue, zero plot, improbable twists sucked out of thin air (tripping on the carpet = lol/wtf). Plus an overblown finale, totally crashing the whole previous "seriousness" to hell (Two-Face huh?). Until then, though, seriously the best series out there right now. Take all ten. EDIT: Season 5 is the best thing to come out of the series field after season 2 of Alias. Back to 5* with a clear conscience. Will miss you Heisenberg.
Best sequel series I've ever seen. Fascinating complex transformation of the main character.
A television series written and filmed with the same conscientiousness with which Walt cooks Blue Sky. The following selection of SPOILERoid notes I took during all five seasons is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis, but an analysis of several sub-areas of the series to at least partially reveal what makes Gilligan's achievement unique. ___ The development of the narrative seems throughout to be determined by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Despite the assumed direction of development (from victim of external circumstances to manipulative monster), it is impossible to know in advance when things will go wrong and who will undergo what character transformation. Breaking Bad fails to meet audience expectations by rejecting established narrative schemas. It unsettles us with its efforts to make ongoing events more likely, creating the impression that almost anything can happen. However, it does not discourage us from forming our own hypotheses. On the contrary, the series itself, through the "foreshadowing" scenes in the prologue, encourages us to actively insert what we see into the whole narrative. The tension is not only drawn from the viewer's uncertainty about what will happen, but also from the knowledge of what each character knows or does not know. The filmmakers work with multiple narrative foci, juxtaposing the conflicting interests of characters who must often face risks coming from different spheres (immediate and extended family, institutions, the underworld). The transformation of the characters' perception is linked to what we know about them, how much we respect them and how many moral transgressions we are willing to forgive. It is fascinating to watch the selfless "spotting" of heroes. You'd be hard pressed to find a character in recent series without guilt. Raising the stakes forces characters to think more ahead, making them better players. Self-stylization and overacting don't go down well with Jesse in particular, who may be the weakest player, but also the figure to whom the strongest cathartic effect is tied in the last episode. ___ The real rival of most characters is their own potential, which they either fail to fulfill (through their own fault and that of the system that repeatedly betrays them) or fulfill at an inadequate cost. The heroes of the narrative are also united by their ambiguity. Each can step out of his or her role, whether accepted willingly or under pressure from the environment. Because nothing is fixed and we are forced to judge any character's decision in the context of his or her previous actions, one can also question Walt's admission in the last episode that the family was merely a cover for his criminal career (which he therefore embarked on for selfish motives, not to provide for his wife and son). Was his motivation really anything other than power and money at first? The use of parallels (Hank the surrogate father of Walt Junior, Walt the surrogate father of Jesse) helps us to rethink our view of the characters, leading us to see similar situations in different contexts and highlighting some of the key themes of the series. ___ Through his career as a drug kingpin, Walt vents his aggression accumulated from many sources. He has not lived up to expectations as the breadwinner of the family, nor has he lived up to expectations as a fatherly authority figure (the son gets advice on how to be a man from Hank). Moreover, he compensates for the failure of his own body with his second life. He also earns money outside the system because he has been excluded from it due to his illness. For as a man with cancer signifies death ("other"), he is rejected by society. Cooking gingerbread allows him to triumph over surrogate father and husband figures and to capitalize on his exceptional intellect, at least outside the official structures. His belief in the traditional or obligatory family model does not leave him for long. It is only in the end, unrestrained, omnipotent and omnibenevolent, that he can give full vent to his potential, transforming himself completely into the man he was perhaps destined to become from the beginning.____ The extraordinary thematic range of the series makes Breaking Bad rewarding material for sociological studies of the anxieties of contemporary America (drugs, money, terminal illness, an ineffective social security system). Those who want to break through cannot honor the law and forever build around themselves a façade of a decent citizen out of hundreds of little lies. The series relativizes many times the separation of "big" lies with a wide reach from small family lies. The essence of both is hypocrisy. Instead of learning to be more open, the characters become increasingly adept at constructing alternate worlds and inventing fictional stories (Walt as a gambler). As everyone gradually discovers, however, the real drama is taking place behind these parrot-like backdrops. It's fascinating to see how the writers guide the characters through a multi-level web of lies, and how they handle their varying awareness of the existence of certain worlds and its supposed inhabitants (the family, the underworld, the job are all distinctly different at first, too, visually, but gradually all "darken" into the same color palette). ___ Breaking Bad is also immensely rewarding in terms of style, which changes not only within episodes but also within individual scenes (by recontextualizing and/or revealing new information, we are led to perceive a scene from a different perspective). The filmmakers have played with the graphic continuity of shots, the unfolding of action in multiple plans, or the creation of meanings through camera position and movement, far more than any Hollywood studio with a budget a hundred times larger. I could watch Scorsese's overdone editing collages until I was delirious, the emblematic space of New Mexico hasn't been used for such a thrilling dusting off of classic western motifs (the train robbery) in years, and the last episode can boldly compete with some of Hitchcock's better thrillers in terms of level of direction. There's a lot more that could be written, but the tone would remain just as celebratory. In fact, Breaking Bad contains so many positives that I find it petty to mention the few minor flaws. It's not often that a series allows you to be virtually uncritical. Thanks for that! 100% Interesting comments: DaViD´82, Radek99, Toj, pleonasm
Best series I've ever seen. Novel structure, perfectly thought out story from the first to the last episode. Fantastic actors, all of them without exception, and displays of first-rate direction.
