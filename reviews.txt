I don't think I'll ever understand what the "filmmakers" were actually trying to do when they made a movie that is desperately awkward, desperately unfunny, desperately completely ".....". Everything here is terrible: nuns instead of thugs, chocolate instead of heroin... and there's no point in trying to watch Plump Fiction. Brrr.
Absolutely nauseating. Its makers deserve to have Marsellus Wallace send niggers with a blowtorch to get the boys to do a bit of fooling around. So their asses can see the Middle Ages, huh, Quentin?
Skald's story and rating is similar to mine. But if I saw the poor guy today who "parodied" (that word can't even be in quotes anymore, because parody is at least a little funny) Travolta's Vincent Vega, he'd get his fist punched. And not just once. Or you know what, you better bring me the "director" of this, I'm ashamed to call it, movie and leave me alone with him and a rubber hose...
I've been looking for so long for a movie that rated as garbage! And finally, my (seemingly endless) search was successful. It doesn't have a script, it doesn't have capable actors, it doesn't have a single good joke... so to hell with it...
Life is like candy. It's full of shit. That's the line I give that one star for. I think the current rating of 8% is a little harsh.
Quentin Tarantino's cult films can be imitated or made fun of in other ways. It could even be done that it would have a head and a heel. But this way, it looks like the idiot and the moron shook hands and said, "Dnéskhá phokhoříme Tharanthýn, ujááé éééáááááá." And they made Plump Fiction. Too many more words.
This is (was) a gossip... There's nothing else to say... Thank you... I don't want any more...
I once saw this obscenity on a tape borrowed from a friend who lent it to me to see what kind of crap he could get his hands on. I watched it for about half an hour and then gave it back to him. You could say - avoid it, but on the other hand - you won't see crap like that anyway :-).
A nerd named Bob Koherr wanted to become a famous film director. He wanted to start his career with a very funny parody of Quentin Tarantino's films. That's why he directed the title "Plump Fiction" in 1997. But it was so stupid, primitive and embarrassing that he never made another film. Nobody wanted to risk making a similar piece of crap again. And so dear Mr. Koherr ended up as a series director at the Disney Channel, where he systematically degenerated the tastes of young viewers. That's the only thing this buffoon is good for. His "Plump Fiction" was mega garbage!
Well, it tries to parody Pulp Fiction, but it's rarely funny and it's more like it's telling its own story than parodying the original film, which was a small plus and surprisingly it made sense at the end, so I don't really understand this low rating.
0/10 = 0%
"From producers WHO SAW Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs & Braveheart" - I haven't seen this "gem", but this amused me :-)
A beautiful revenge on the devil Tarantino.
Now that was really "clover" like a pig. One of the most embarrassing movies I've ever seen, but I dare say there are even worse parodies out there, and that's saying something, because this was really one big piece of shit. I laughed about two or three times, most of the characters were incredibly pathetic - as was the whole script. I probably had the most fun with the line with the fake nuns. Plus it was all incredibly whiny and the cow at the beginning in the restaurant or the pair of would-be serial killers - disaster. I'll give that one star for the final nun fight...
A movie like Pulp Fiction doesn't deserve a parody. Plus, it's more embarrassing than funny. Amateurish performances by the "actors". I regret that I wasted a few minutes of my life watching this movie. I hope the director never makes anything else. An embarrassment of embarrassments. 0%
What was that? Fifteen minutes and I was foaming at the mouth!
I definitely find it strange how anyone here expects enlightenment in this over-the-top parody. Of course, this isn't something that can be compared to the classics ( STRELS ), but the genre is defined by a style that is a constant. It just depends on how the creators themselves approach it. Well these guys, in my opinion, have followed the rules like a tick.
Cramp... crappy cramp...
The film is truly the epitome of funny. But (without irony this time) I was quite amused by the tagline "From producers who have seen Pulp Fiction, The Gaunters and Braveheart"...
The absolute pinnacle of pathetic and tasteless.Seriously the worst piece of cinematic garbage you can imagine.
